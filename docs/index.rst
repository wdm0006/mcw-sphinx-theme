Overview
--------

The Wabi Sphinx Theme provides a consistent look and feel with the
`mcginniscommawill.com <https://mcginniscommawill.com>`_ website, allowing
Sphinx documentation to be hosted on a subdomain while appearing as part
of the same site.

Features
--------

- **Matching Design**: Identical styling to the Hugo Wabi theme
- **Warm Color Palette**: Cream, sand, and terracotta tones
- **Typography**: Carefully selected fonts for readability
- **Unified Navigation**: Same top nav as the main website
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly with collapsible navigation

Quick Start
-----------

Install the theme::

    pip install wabi-sphinx-theme

Configure in your ``conf.py``::

    html_theme = "wabi_sphinx_theme"

That's it! Your documentation will now match the Wabi aesthetic.
